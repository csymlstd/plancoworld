<div class="content is-medium"><p class="has-text-primary">A priority pass is a wristband that your guests can purchase from an Information Booth which will let them skip a large majority of a line for a ride. This can help boost your park’s revenue because it is sold in addition to park entry fees and ride fees. To make sure guests buy a priority pass and that they are happy with their purchase, a few things must be done.</p></div>

<h4 class="title is-4">How to Sell Priority Passes</h4>
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
        <p>Firstly, there needs to be an information booth somewhere in the park because this is where the priority passes will be sold. You can set the price of the priority pass by clicking on the Information Booth which they are sold and going to the ‘Items for Sale’ tab.</p>

        <p>Note that the maximum price for a Priority Pass is $30. If you attempt to set a price higher than this maximum, the price will automatically be set to $30.</p>

        <p>You can also set the Priority Pass price via the Park Management dialogue. Navigate to this dialogue window by clicking the <code>Park Management</code> button on the left side of the bottom toolbar. In the Park Management dialogue window, go to the <code>Overview</code> tab and click the <code>Ticket Prices</code> Icon in the menu on the left side of the window. Under the <code>Entry Ticket Prices</code> section you can change the price of Priority Pass.</p>

<h4 class="title is-4">Priority Pass Queues</h4>
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
        <p>Once you have an Information Booth to sell the Priority Pass, Priority Pass Queues will need to be added to the ride queues. In general, it is best to add Priority Pass Queues to at least the most popular rides. You can also add a Priority Pass Queue to all of the rides. If you do not have Priority Pass Queues for rides, guests will not buy the Priority Pass and guests who have bought the pass will complain it was not worth the money.</p>

        <p>To add a Priority Pass Queue there must already be a ride with a normal queue constructed. Click on the ride you would like to add a Priority Pass Queue to and under the <code>Options</code> tab on the ride dialogue box. Scroll to the bottom and click the <code>Enable Priority Pass</code> button.</p>

        <p>Now you will be prompted to add the queue. Click the <code>Place Priority Pass Entrance</code> button. The entrance should be placed near the beginning of the queue for the ride. Once this has been placed, you can click the <code>Place Priority Pass Exit</code>. The exit should be place nearest to the ride itself, at the front of the line. Once the exit has been placed, click the <code>Connect the Priority Pass queue</code> button. Now you can create the path from the Priority Pass Entrance to the Priority Pass exit.</p>

        <p>When this is done correctly, the Priority Pass Queue should be much shorter than the entire ride queue. It will bypass most of the line and take the Priority Pass holders directly to the front of the line.</p>

<h4 class="title is-4">Set Priority</h4>
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
        <p>You can also set what level of priority the Priority Pass holders will have over the rest of the queue. To change this level of priority, open the ride dialogue box by selecting the ride. Under the ‘Options’ tab, scroll to the very bottom. This is where the ‘Priority Pass Queue’ section will be found. By clicking the drop down menu, you may select the following options: <code>Low Priority</code>, <code>Equal Priority</code>, or <code>High Priority</code>.</p>
